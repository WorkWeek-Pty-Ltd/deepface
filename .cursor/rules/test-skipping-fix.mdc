# Test Skipping Fix
# File patterns: .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml, api_tests/conftest.py, api_tests/test_api.py

## Issue Overview
Tests in the CI/CD pipeline were being skipped in production deployments with the following output:

```
api_tests/test_api.py::TestHealth::test_server_health SKIPPED (Fly.i...) [  7%]
api_tests/test_api.py::TestAuthentication::test_no_api_key SKIPPED (...) [ 15%]
...
======================= 13 skipped in 305.08s (0:05:05) =======================
```

## Root Cause Analysis
Tests were being skipped due to:
1. Machine warmup time after deployment 
2. Environment variables not being explicitly set
3. `conftest.py` has a machine readiness check that skips tests if machines aren't ready

## Solution Implemented
The following changes were made to address the issue:

1. **Added Wait Time**: Added a 60-second wait after deployment to ensure machines are fully provisioned
2. **Machine Status Check**: Added a step to check machine status before running tests
3. **Environment Variable Export**: Explicitly exported API_KEY and API_BASE_URL before running tests

## CI/CD Fixes in Detail
The following code was added to the CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
- name: Wait for production environment to be ready
  run: |
    echo "Waiting for machines to be fully provisioned (60 seconds)"
    sleep 60
    flyctl machine list --app deepface-workweek

- name: Run tests against production
  run: |
    # We need to make sure we have correct API keys and URL
    export API_KEY=${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
    export API_BASE_URL=https://deepface-workweek.fly.dev
    echo "Running tests against $API_BASE_URL"
    pytest api_tests/test_api.py -v
```

## How the Fix Works
1. The wait period gives machines time to fully initialize after deployment
2. The machine status check confirms machines are running before tests start
3. Explicitly exporting environment variables ensures they're correctly set
4. The `conftest.py` file's machine readiness check will proceed with tests

## Verification
The fix has been verified by observing test runs in the CI/CD pipeline. Tests no longer show as SKIPPED and are now either PASSED or FAILED.

## Further Considerations
- If tests are still skipped, the wait time may need to be increased
- Monitor cold start times to adjust wait periods as needed
- Consider implementing readiness probes in the application to allow the CI/CD pipeline to wait for actual application readiness
