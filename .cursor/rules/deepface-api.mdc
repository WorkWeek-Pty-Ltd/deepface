# DeepFace API Project Rules
# File patterns: *.py

## Project Overview
DeepFace API is a REST API for face recognition and analysis using the DeepFace library.
The API is deployed on Fly.io and uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

## Architecture
- **API Routes**: `deepface/api/src/modules/core/routes.py` - All endpoints and handlers
- **Service Layer**: `deepface/api/src/modules/core/service.py` - Business logic
- **Authentication**: `deepface/api/src/modules/core/auth.py` - API key auth
- **App Entry**: `deepface/api/src/app.py` - Flask application setup

## Deployment Environments
- **Development**: https://deepface-workweek-dev.fly.dev (deployed on PR creation)
- **Staging**: https://deepface-workweek-staging.fly.dev (deployed on merge to main)
- **Production**: https://deepface-workweek.fly.dev (deployed on version tag)

## Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch: `feature/{feature-name}`
2. Implement changes and tests
3. Create PR to main branch
4. CI/CD deploys to development and runs tests
5. Merge to main for staging deployment
6. Create version tag for production deployment

## Testing
- **Manual Tests**: `tests/` directory
- **API Tests for CI/CD**: `api_tests/test_api.py`
- **Important**: Always add test cases to `api_tests/test_api.py` for CI/CD

## Coding Standards
- Python 3.10
- Follow PEP 8
- Use Google-style docstrings
- API responses should follow consistent format:
  - Success: 200 status with relevant data
  - Error: Appropriate error code with message

## Best Practices
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Document new parameters in README.md and code
- Test in all environments before merging
- CI/CD flow: PR → Development → Staging → Production
